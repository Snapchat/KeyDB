.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.BR memkind_error_message ()
converts an error number
.I err
returned by a member of the memkind
interface to an error message
.I msg
where the maximum size of the message is passed by the
.I size
parameter.

.B "HEAP MANAGEMENT:"
.br
The functions described in this section define a heap manager with an
interface modeled on the ISO C standard API's, except that the user
must specify the
.I kind
of memory with the first argument to each function. See the
.B KINDS
section below for a full description of the implemented kinds.
For file-backed kind of memory see
.BR memkind_create_pmem() .
.PP
.BR memkind_malloc ()
allocates
.I size
bytes of uninitialized memory of the specified
.IR "kind" .
The allocated space is suitably aligned (after possible pointer
coercion) for storage of any type of object. If
.I size
is 0, then
.BR memkind_malloc ()
returns NULL.
.PP
.BR memkind_calloc ()
allocates space for
.I num
objects each
.I size
bytes in length in memory of the specified
.IR "kind" .
The result is identical to calling
.BR memkind_malloc ()
with an argument of
.IR num * size ,
with the exception that the allocated memory is explicitly
initialized to zero bytes.
If
.I num
or
.I size
is 0, then
.BR memkind_calloc ()
returns NULL.
.PP
.BR memkind_realloc ()
changes the size of the previously allocated memory referenced by
.I ptr
to
.I size
bytes of the specified
.IR "kind" .
The contents of the memory are unchanged up to the lesser of
the new and old sizes. If the new size is larger, the contents of the
newly allocated portion of the memory are undefined. Upon success, the
memory referenced by
.I ptr
is freed and a pointer to the newly allocated high bandwidth memory is
returned.

.BR Note:
.BR memkind_realloc ()
may move the memory allocation, resulting in a different return value
than
.IR "ptr" .

If
.I ptr
is NULL, the
.BR memkind_realloc ()
function behaves identically to
.BR memkind_malloc ()
for the specified size.
The address
.IR "ptr" ,
if not NULL, must have been returned by a previous call to
.BR memkind_malloc (),
.BR memkind_calloc (),
.BR memkind_realloc (),
or
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ()
with the same
.I kind
as specified to the call to
.BR memkind_realloc ().
Otherwise, if
.I memkind_free(kind, ptr)
was called before, undefined behavior occurs.
.PP
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ()
allocates
.I size
bytes of memory of a specified
.I kind
such that the allocation's base address
is an even multiple of
.IR "alignment" ,
and returns the allocation in the value pointed to by
.IR "memptr" .
The requested
.I alignment
must be a power of 2 at least as large as
.IR "sizeof(void *)" .
If
.I size
is 0, then
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ()
returns NULL.
.PP
.BR memkind_malloc_usable_size ()
function provides the same semantics as
.BR malloc_usable_size(3),
but operates on specified
.I kind.

.BR Note:
.BR memkind_malloc_usable_size ()
is not supported by TBB heap manager described in
.B ENVIRONMENT
section.

.PP
.BR memkind_free ()
causes the allocated memory referenced by
.I ptr
to be made available for future allocations. This pointer
must have been returned by a previous call to
.BR memkind_malloc (),
.BR memkind_calloc (),
.BR memkind_realloc (),
or
.BR memkind_posix_memalign ().
Otherwise, if
.I memkind_free(kind, ptr)
was already called before, undefined behavior occurs.
If
.I ptr
is NULL, no operation is performed.
The value of
.B MEMKIND_DEFAULT
can be given as the
.I kind
for all buffers allocated by a kind that leverages the jemalloc
allocator. In cases where the kind is unknown in the
context of the call to
.BR memkind_free ()
.B 0
can be given as the
.I kind
specified to
.BR memkind_free ()
but this will require a look up that can be bypassed by specifying
a non-zero value.
.sp
.B "KIND MANAGEMENT:"
.br
There are built-in kinds that are always available and these are enumerated in the
.B KINDS
section. The user can also create their own kinds of memory. This
section describes the API's that enable the tracking of the different
kinds of memory and determining their properties.
.PP
.BR memkind_create_pmem ()
is a convenient function used to create a file-backed kind of memory.
It allocates a temporary file in the given directory
.IR dir .
The file is created in a fashion similar to
.BR tmpfile (3),
so that the file name does not appear when the directory is listed and
the space is automatically freed when the program terminates.
The file is truncated to a size of
.I max_size
bytes and the resulting space is memory-mapped.
.br
Note that the actual file system space is not allocated immediately, but only
on a call to
.BR memkind_pmem_mmap ()
(see
.BR memkind_pmem (3)).
This allows to create a pmem memkind of a pretty large size without the
need to reserve in advance the corresponding file system space for the entire
heap. If the value of
.I max_size
equals 0, pmem memkind is only limited by the capacity of the file system mounted under
.I dir
argument.
 The minimum
.I max_size
value which allows to limit the size of kind by the library is defined as
.BR MEMKIND_PMEM_MIN_SIZE .
Calling
.BR memkind_create_pmem ()
with a size smaller than that and different than 0 will return an error.
The maximum allowed size is not limited by
.BR memkind ,
but by the file system specified by the
.I dir
argument.
The
.I max_size
passed in is the raw size of the memory pool and
.B jemalloc
will use some of that space for its own metadata.
Returns zero if the pmem memkind is created successfully or an error code from the
.B ERRORS
section if not.
.PP
.BR memkind_create_kind ()
creates kind that allocates memory with specific memory type, memory binding policy and flags (see
.B MEMORY FLAGS
section).
The
.IR memtype_flags
(see
.B MEMORY TYPES
section) determine memory types to allocate,
.IR policy
argument is policy for specifying page binding to memory types selected by
.IR memtype_flags .
Returns zero if the specified kind is created successfully or an error code from the
.B ERRORS
section if not.
.PP
.BR memkind_destroy_kind ()
destroys previously created kind object, which must have been returned by a previous call to
.BR memkind_create_pmem ()
or
.BR memkind_create_kind () .
Otherwise, or if
.I memkind_destroy_kind(kind)
was already called before, undefined behavior occurs.
Note that, when the kind was returned by
.BR memkind_create_kind ()
all allocated memory must be freed before kind is destroyed,
otherwise this will cause memory leak. When the kind was returned by
.BR memkind_create_pmem ()
all allocated memory will be freed after kind will be destroyed.
.PP
.BR memkind_check_available ()
returns zero if the specified
.I kind
is available or an error code from the
.B ERRORS
section if it is not.
.PP
.BR MEMKIND_PMEM_MIN_SIZE
The minimum size which allows to limit the file-backed memory partition.
.sp
.B "DECORATORS:"
.br
The memkind library enables the user to define decorator functions that
can be called before and after each memkind heap management API. The
decorators that are called at the beginning of the function end are named
after that function with
.I _pre
appended to the name and those that are called at the end of the
function are named after that function with
.I _post
appended to the name. These are weak symbols and if they are not
present at link time they are not called. The memkind library does
not define these symbols which are reserved for user definition.
These decorators can be used to track calls to the heap management
interface or to modify parameters. The decorators that are called at
the beginning of the allocator pass all inputs by reference and the
decorators that are called at the end of the allocator pass the output
by reference. This enables the modification of the input and output
of each heap management function by the decorators.
.sp
.B "LIBRARY VERSION:"
.br
The memkind library version scheme consist major, minor and patch numbers separated by dot. Combining those numbers, we got the following representation:
.br
major.minor.patch, where:
.br
	-major number is incremented whenever API is changed (loss of backward compatibility),
.br
	-minor number is incremented whenever additional extensions are introduced or behavior has been changed,
.br
	-patch number is incremented whenever small bug fixes are added.
.sp
memkind library provide numeric representation of the version by exposing the following API:
.PP
.BR memkind_get_version ()
return version number represented by a single integer number, obtained from the formula:
.br
major * 1000000 + minor * 1000 + patch
.sp
Note: major < 1 means unstable API.
.sp
API standards:
.br
-STANDARD API, API is considered as stable
.br
-NON-STANDARD API, API is considered as stable, however this is not a standard way to use memkind
.br
-EXPERIMENTAL API, API is considered as unstable and the subject to change
.br
.sp
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR memkind_calloc (),
.BR memkind_malloc (),
and
.BR memkind_realloc (),
returns the pointer to the allocated memory or NULL if the request fails.
.BR memkind_malloc_usable_size ()
returns the number of usable bytes in the block of allocated memory pointed to by
.I ptr,
a pointer to a block of memory allocated by
.BR memkind_malloc ()
or a related function. If
.I ptr
is NULL, 0 is returned.
.BR memkind_free ()
and
.BR memkind_error_message ()
do not have return values.
All other memkind API's return 0 upon
success and an error code defined in the
.B ERRORS
section upon failure.
The memkind library avoids setting
.I errno
directly, but calls to underlying libraries and system calls may set
.IR errno
( e.g.
.BR memkind_create_pmem ()
).

.SH "MEMORY FLAGS"
.TP
.B MEMKIND_MASK_PAGE_SIZE_2MB
Allocation backed by 2MB page size.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HBW_NODES
This environment variable is a comma separated list of NUMA nodes that
are treated as high bandwidth. Uses the
.I libnuma
routine
.BR numa_parse_nodestring ()
for parsing, so the syntax described in the
.BR numa (3)
man page for this routine applies: e.g. 1-3,5 is a valid setting.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_ARENA_NUM_PER_KIND
This environment variable allows leveraging internal mechanism of
the library for setting number of arenas per kind. Value should be
a positive integer (not greater than INT_MAX defined in limits.h).
The user should set the value based on the characteristics
of application that is using the library. Higher value can
provide better performance in extremely multithreaded applications at
the cost of memory overhead. See section "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES" of
.BR jemalloc (3)
for more details about arenas.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HOG_MEMORY
Controls behavior of memkind with regards to returning memory to underlaying OS. Setting
.B MEMKIND_HOG_MEMORY
to "1" causes memkind to not release memory to OS in anticipation of memory reuse soon. This will
improve latency of 'free' operations but increase memory usage.
.TP
.B MEMKIND_DEBUG
Controls logging mechanism in memkind. Setting
.B MEMKIND_DEBUG
to "1" enables printing messages like errors and general information about environment to
.IR stderr .
.TP
.B MEMKIND_HEAP_MANAGER
Controls heap management behavior in memkind library by switching to one of the available heap managers.
.br
Values:
.br
    JEMALLOC – sets the jemalloc heap manager
.br
    TBB – sets the Intel Threading Building Blocks heap manager. This option requires installed
    Intel Threading Building Blocks library.
If the MEMKIND_HEAP_MANAGER is not set then the jemalloc heap manager will be used by default.
.SH "SYSTEM CONFIGURATION"
Interfaces for obtaining 2MB (HUGETLB) need allocated
huge pages in the kernel's huge page pool.
.TP
.B HUGETLB (huge pages)
Current number of "persistent" huge pages can be read from /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages file.
Proposed way of setting hugepages is: "sudo sysctl vm.nr_hugepages=<number_of_hugepages>".
More information can be found here:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt
.SH "STATIC LINKING"
.TP
When linking statically against memkind, libmemkind.a should be used together with its dependencies libnuma and pthread. Pthread can be linked by adding /usr/lib64/libpthread.a as a dependency (exact path may vary). Typically libnuma will need to be compiled from sources to use it as a static dependency. libnuma can be reached on github: https://github.com/numactl/numactl
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
.TP
.B HUGETLB (huge pages)
There might be some overhead in huge pages consumption caused by heap management.
If your allocation fails because of OOM, please try to allocate extra huge pages (e.g. 8 huge pages).
