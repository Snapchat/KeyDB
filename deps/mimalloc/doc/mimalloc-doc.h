/*! \mainpage

This is the API documentation of the
[mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) allocator
(pronounced "me-malloc") -- a
general purpose allocator with excellent [performance](bench.html)
characteristics. Initially
developed by Daan Leijen for the run-time systems of the
[Koka](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka) and [Lean](https://github.com/leanprover/lean) languages.

It is a drop-in replacement for `malloc` and can be used in other programs
without code changes, for example, on Unix you can use it as:
```
> LD_PRELOAD=/usr/bin/libmimalloc.so  myprogram
```

Notable aspects of the design include:

- __small and consistent__: the library is about 8k LOC using simple and
  consistent data structures. This makes it very suitable
  to integrate and adapt in other projects. For runtime systems it
  provides hooks for a monotonic _heartbeat_ and deferred freeing (for
  bounded worst-case times with reference counting).
- __free list sharding__: instead of one big free list (per size class) we have
  many smaller lists per "mimalloc page" which reduces fragmentation and
  increases locality --
  things that are allocated close in time get allocated close in memory.
  (A mimalloc page contains blocks of one size class and is usually 64KiB on a 64-bit system).
- __free list multi-sharding__: the big idea! Not only do we shard the free list
  per mimalloc page, but for each page we have multiple free lists. In particular, there
  is one list for thread-local `free` operations, and another one for concurrent `free`
  operations. Free-ing from another thread can now be a single CAS without needing
  sophisticated coordination between threads. Since there will be 
  thousands of separate free lists, contention is naturally distributed over the heap,
  and the chance of contending on a single location will be low -- this is quite
  similar to randomized algorithms like skip lists where adding
  a random oracle removes the need for a more complex algorithm.
- __eager page reset__: when a "page" becomes empty (with increased chance
  due to free list sharding) the memory is marked to the OS as unused ("reset" or "purged")
  reducing (real) memory pressure and fragmentation, especially in long running
  programs.
- __secure__: _mimalloc_ can be build in secure mode, adding guard pages,
  randomized allocation, encrypted free lists, etc. to protect against various
  heap vulnerabilities. The performance penalty is only around 3% on average
  over our benchmarks.
- __first-class heaps__: efficiently create and use multiple heaps to allocate across different regions.
  A heap can be destroyed at once instead of deallocating each object separately.
- __bounded__: it does not suffer from _blowup_ \[1\], has bounded worst-case allocation
  times (_wcat_), bounded space overhead (~0.2% meta-data, with at most 12.5% waste in allocation sizes),
  and has no internal points of contention using only atomic operations.
- __fast__: In our benchmarks (see [below](#performance)),
  _mimalloc_ outperforms all other leading allocators (_jemalloc_, _tcmalloc_, _Hoard_, etc),
  and usually uses less memory (up to 25% more in the worst case). A nice property
  is that it does consistently well over a wide range of benchmarks.

You can read more on the design of _mimalloc_ in the
[technical report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/mimalloc-free-list-sharding-in-action)
which also has detailed benchmark results.

/*! \page build Building

Checkout the sources from Github:
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc
```

## Windows

Open `ide/vs2019/mimalloc.sln` in Visual Studio 2019 and build (or `ide/vs2017/mimalloc.sln`).
The `mimalloc` project builds a static library (in `out/msvc-x64`), while the
`mimalloc-override` project builds a DLL for overriding malloc
in the entire program.

## macOS, Linux, BSD, etc.

We use [`cmake`](https://cmake.org)<sup>1</sup> as the build system:

```
> mkdir -p out/release
> cd out/release
> cmake ../..
> make
```
This builds the library as a shared (dynamic)
library (`.so` or `.dylib`), a static library (`.a`), and
as a single object file (`.o`).

`> sudo make install` (install the library and header files in `/usr/local/lib`  and `/usr/local/include`)

You can build the debug version which does many internal checks and
maintains detailed statistics as:

```
> mkdir -p out/debug
> cd out/debug
> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..
> make
```
This will name the shared library as `libmimalloc-debug.so`.

Finally, you can build a _secure_ version that uses guard pages, encrypted
free lists, etc, as:
```
> mkdir -p out/secure
> cd out/secure
> cmake -DMI_SECURE=ON ../..
> make
```
This will name the shared library as `libmimalloc-secure.so`.
Use `ccmake`<sup>2</sup> instead of `cmake`
to see and customize all the available build options.

Notes:
1. Install CMake: `sudo apt-get install cmake`
2. Install CCMake: `sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui`

*/

/*! \page using Using the library

### Build

The preferred usage is including `<mimalloc.h>`, linking with
the shared- or static library, and using the `mi_malloc` API exclusively for allocation. For example,
```
gcc -o myprogram -lmimalloc myfile.c
```

mimalloc uses only safe OS calls (`mmap` and `VirtualAlloc`) and can co-exist
with other allocators linked to the same program.
If you use `cmake`, you can simply use:
```
find_package(mimalloc 1.0 REQUIRED)
```
in your `CMakeLists.txt` to find a locally installed mimalloc. Then use either:
```
target_link_libraries(myapp PUBLIC mimalloc)
```
to link with the shared (dynamic) library, or:
```
target_link_libraries(myapp PUBLIC mimalloc-static)
```
to link with the static library. See `test\CMakeLists.txt` for an example.

### C++
For best performance in C++ programs, it is also recommended to override the
global `new` and `delete` operators. For convience, mimalloc provides
[`mimalloc-new-delete.h`](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/blob/master/include/mimalloc-new-delete.h) which does this for you -- just include it in a single(!) source file in your project.

In C++, mimalloc also provides the `mi_stl_allocator` struct which implements the `std::allocator`
interface. For example:
```
std::vector<some_struct, mi_stl_allocator<some_struct>> vec;
vec.push_back(some_struct());
```

### Statistics

You can pass environment variables to print verbose messages (`MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1`)
and statistics (`MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1`) (in the debug version):
```
> env MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1 ./cfrac 175451865205073170563711388363

175451865205073170563711388363 = 374456281610909315237213 * 468551

   process: user: 1.781s, system: 0.016s, faults: 756, reclaims: 0, rss: 2.7 mb
```

The above model of using the `mi_` prefixed API is not always possible
though in existing programs that already use the standard malloc interface,
and another option is to override the standard malloc interface
completely and redirect all calls to the _mimalloc_ library instead.

See \ref overrides for more info.

*/

/*! \page environment Environment Options

You can set further options either programmatically (using [`mi_option_set`](https://microsoft.github.io/mimalloc/group__options.html)),
or via environment variables.

- `MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1`: show statistics when the program terminates.
- `MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1`: show verbose messages.
- `MIMALLOC_SHOW_ERRORS=1`: show error and warning messages.
- `MIMALLOC_PAGE_RESET=0`: by default, mimalloc will reset (or purge) OS pages when not in use to signal to the OS
   that the underlying physical memory can be reused. This can reduce memory fragmentation in long running (server)
   programs. By setting it to `0` no such page resets will be done which can improve performance for programs that are not long
   running. As an alternative, the `MIMALLOC_RESET_DELAY=`<msecs> can be set higher (100ms by default) to make the page
   reset occur less frequently instead of turning it off completely.
- `MIMALLOC_LARGE_OS_PAGES=1`: use large OS pages (2MiB) when available; for some workloads this can significantly
   improve performance. Use `MIMALLOC_VERBOSE` to check if the large OS pages are enabled -- usually one needs
   to explicitly allow large OS pages (as on [Windows][windows-huge] and [Linux][linux-huge]). However, sometimes
   the OS is very slow to reserve contiguous physical memory for large OS pages so use with care on systems that
   can have fragmented memory (for that reason, we generally recommend to use `MIMALLOC_RESERVE_HUGE_OS_PAGES` instead when possible).
- `MIMALLOC_RESERVE_HUGE_OS_PAGES=N`: where N is the number of 1GiB _huge_ OS pages. This reserves the huge pages at
   startup and sometimes this can give a large (latency) performance improvement on big workloads.
   Usually it is better to not use
   `MIMALLOC_LARGE_OS_PAGES` in combination with this setting. Just like large OS pages, use with care as reserving
   contiguous physical memory can take a long time when memory is fragmented (but reserving the huge pages is done at
   startup only once).
   Note that we usually need to explicitly enable huge OS pages (as on [Windows][windows-huge] and [Linux][linux-huge])). With huge OS pages, it may be beneficial to set the setting
   `MIMALLOC_EAGER_COMMIT_DELAY=N` (`N` is 1 by default) to delay the initial `N` segments (of 4MiB)
   of a thread to not allocate in the huge OS pages; this prevents threads that are short lived
   and allocate just a little to take up space in the huge OS page area (which cannot be reset).

Use caution when using `fork` in combination with either large or huge OS pages: on a fork, the OS uses copy-on-write
for all pages in the original process including the huge OS pages. When any memory is now written in that area, the
OS will copy the entire 1GiB huge page (or 2MiB large page) which can cause the memory usage to grow in big increments.

/*! \page overrides Overriding Malloc

Overriding the standard `malloc` can be done either _dynamically_ or _statically_.

## Dynamic override

This is the recommended way to override the standard malloc interface.


### Linux, BSD

On these systems we preload the mimalloc shared
library so all calls to the standard `malloc` interface are
resolved to the _mimalloc_ library.

- `env LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.so myprogram`

You can set extra environment variables to check that mimalloc is running,
like:
```
env MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.so myprogram
```
or run with the debug version to get detailed statistics:
```
env MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libmimalloc-debug.so myprogram
```

### MacOS

On macOS we can also preload the mimalloc shared
library so all calls to the standard `malloc` interface are
resolved to the _mimalloc_ library.

- `env DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE=1 DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/libmimalloc.dylib myprogram`

Note that certain security restrictions may apply when doing this from
the [shell](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43941322/dyld-insert-libraries-ignored-when-calling-application-through-bash).

(Note: macOS support for dynamic overriding is recent, please report any issues.)


### Windows

Overriding on Windows is robust and has the
particular advantage to be able to redirect all malloc/free calls that go through
the (dynamic) C runtime allocator, including those from other DLL's or libraries.

The overriding on Windows requires that you link your program explicitly with
the mimalloc DLL and use the C-runtime library as a DLL (using the `/MD` or `/MDd` switch).
Also, the `mimalloc-redirect.dll` (or `mimalloc-redirect32.dll`) must be available
in the same folder as the main `mimalloc-override.dll` at runtime (as it is a dependency).
The redirection DLL ensures that all calls to the C runtime malloc API get redirected to
mimalloc (in `mimalloc-override.dll`).

To ensure the mimalloc DLL is loaded at run-time it is easiest to insert some
call to the mimalloc API in the `main` function, like `mi_version()`
(or use the `/INCLUDE:mi_version` switch on the linker). See the `mimalloc-override-test` project
for an example on how to use this. For best performance on Windows with C++, it
is also recommended to also override the `new`/`delete` operations (by including
[`mimalloc-new-delete.h`](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/blob/master/include/mimalloc-new-delete.h) a single(!) source file in your project).

The environment variable `MIMALLOC_DISABLE_REDIRECT=1` can be used to disable dynamic
overriding at run-time. Use `MIMALLOC_VERBOSE=1` to check if mimalloc was successfully redirected.

(Note: in principle, it is possible to even patch existing executables without any recompilation
if they are linked with the dynamic C runtime (`ucrtbase.dll`) -- just put the `mimalloc-override.dll`
into the import table (and put `mimalloc-redirect.dll` in the same folder)
Such patching can be done for example with [CFF Explorer](https://ntcore.com/?page_id=388)).


## Static override

On Unix systems, you can also statically link with _mimalloc_ to override the standard
malloc interface. The recommended way is to link the final program with the
_mimalloc_ single object file (`mimalloc-override.o`). We use
an object file instead of a library file as linkers give preference to
that over archives to resolve symbols. To ensure that the standard
malloc interface resolves to the _mimalloc_ library, link it as the first
object file. For example:

```
gcc -o myprogram mimalloc-override.o  myfile1.c ...
```

## List of Overrides:

The specific functions that get redirected to the _mimalloc_ library are:

```
// C
void*  malloc(size_t size);
void*  calloc(size_t size, size_t n);
void*  realloc(void* p, size_t newsize);
void   free(void* p);

// C++
void   operator delete(void* p);
void   operator delete[](void* p);

void*  operator new(std::size_t n) noexcept(false);
void*  operator new[](std::size_t n) noexcept(false);
void*  operator new( std::size_t n, std::align_val_t align) noexcept(false);
void*  operator new[]( std::size_t n, std::align_val_t align) noexcept(false);

void*  operator new  ( std::size_t count, const std::nothrow_t& tag);
void*  operator new[]( std::size_t count, const std::nothrow_t& tag);
void*  operator new  ( std::size_t count, std::align_val_t al, const std::nothrow_t&);
void*  operator new[]( std::size_t count, std::align_val_t al, const std::nothrow_t&);

// Posix
int    posix_memalign(void** p, size_t alignment, size_t size);

// Linux
void*  memalign(size_t alignment, size_t size);
void*  aligned_alloc(size_t alignment, size_t size);
void*  valloc(size_t size);
void*  pvalloc(size_t size);
size_t malloc_usable_size(void *p);

// BSD
void*  reallocarray( void* p, size_t count, size_t size );
void*  reallocf(void* p, size_t newsize);
void   cfree(void* p);

// Windows
void*  _expand(void* p, size_t newsize);
size_t _msize(void* p);

void*  _malloc_dbg(size_t size, int block_type, const char* fname, int line);
void*  _realloc_dbg(void* p, size_t newsize, int block_type, const char* fname, int line);
void*  _calloc_dbg(size_t count, size_t size, int block_type, const char* fname, int line);
void*  _expand_dbg(void* p, size_t size, int block_type, const char* fname, int line);
size_t _msize_dbg(void* p, int block_type);
void   _free_dbg(void* p, int block_type);
```

/*! \page bench Performance

We tested _mimalloc_ against many other top allocators over a wide
range of benchmarks, ranging from various real world programs to
synthetic benchmarks that see how the allocator behaves under more
extreme circumstances.

In our benchmarks, _mimalloc_ always outperforms all other leading
allocators (_jemalloc_, _tcmalloc_, _Hoard_, etc) (Apr 2019),
and usually uses less memory (up to 25% more in the worst case).
A nice property is that it does *consistently* well over the wide
range of benchmarks.

See the [Performance](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc#Performance)
section in the _mimalloc_ repository for benchmark results,
or the the technical report for detailed benchmark results.
