Package: keydb
Architecture: all
Depends:
 keydb-server (<< ${binary:Version}.1~),
 keydb-server (>= ${binary:Version}),
 ${misc:Depends},
Description: Persistent key-value database with network interface (metapackage)
 keydb is a key-value database in a similar vein to memcache but the dataset
 is non-volatile. keydb additionally provides native support for atomically
 manipulating and querying data structures such as lists and sets.
 .
 The dataset is stored entirely in memory and periodically flushed to disk.
 .
 This package depends on the keydb-server package.
