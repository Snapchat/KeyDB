/*
 * SDS compatibility header.
 *
 * This simple file maps sds types and calls to their unique hiredis symbol names.
 * It's useful when we build Hiredis as a dependency of Redis and want to call
 * Hiredis' sds symbols rather than the ones built into Redis, as the libraries
 * have slightly diverged and could cause hard to track down ABI incompatibility
 * bugs.
